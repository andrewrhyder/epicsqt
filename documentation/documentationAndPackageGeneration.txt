Package generation:

Rebuild documentation:
(note, preparation of pdf help from latex source requires
pdflatex available in lexlive "yum install texlive-latex")
  update PROJECT_NUMBER in ~/epicsqt/documentation/source/Doxyfile
  cd ~/epicsqt/documentation/source
  doxygen Doxyfile
  cd ~/epicsqt/documentation/latex
  make pdf
  cp refman.pdf ~/epicsqt/documentation/QE_ReferenceManual.pdf

Ensure repository is up to date:
  cd ~/epicsqt
  svn commit -m "reason for any changes"

Save current version just in case:
For example, if a new file was not added to svn
  cd ~
  mv epicsqt epicsqtSaveNN

Recover and rebuild repository.
This ensures the package will really contain what is in the
repository and will build.
  svn co https://epicsqt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epicsqt epicsqt
  qtcreator epicsqt/epicsqt.pro
  (turn off shaddow build and build it)

Recover repository and remove svn files:
  cd ~
  rm -rf epicsqt
  svn co https://epicsqt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epicsqt epicsqt
  find epicsqt -name *.svn -exec rm -rfv {} \;

Package project (version example below is 2.0.0 - change as required)
  cd ~
  tar -z -cvf epicsqt-2.0.0-src.tar.gz epicsqt
  check epicsqt-2.0.0-src.tar.gz is a sensible size compared to last package

  go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/epicsqt/
  select 'files' (https://sourceforge.net/projects/epicsqt/files/)
  Press 'Add' button - only available when logged in
                       (and perhaps only available in firefox?
  browse, select ~/epicsqt-2.0.0-src.tar.gz and upload
  revisit summary (https://sourceforge.net/projects/epicsqt/) and check.

Verify package:
  cd ~
  rm -rf epicsqt
  goto https://sourceforge.net/projects/epicsqt/ and press 'Download'
  tar -xf <downloadLocation>/epicsqt-2.0.0-src.tar.gz
  cd epicsqt
  qtcreator
  open ~/epicsqt/epicsqt.pro
  turn off shaddow build and build it
  run QEGui

  check ~/epicsqt/documentation/QE_ReferenceManual.pdf

Prior to ongoing development:
Restore svn copy
  cd ~
  rm -rf epicsqt
  svn co https://epicsqt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epicsqt epicsqt
