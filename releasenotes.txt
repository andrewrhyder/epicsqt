517:
Update version to 2.1 in preparation of package. Update design doco with

514:
QEButtons - on click, press, or release, still write a to variable if
defined, but also emit an integer signal of the same value (if variable
is defined or not). This is useful for selecting a tab in a tab widget
on the same form. (user interface design pdf not generated)
QEImage. Extend to 4 region of interest selections.

513:
Don't antialias markup text. Artifacts were left when removing markup
text on Linux. (Because antialias resulted in some pixels drawn blended
with original image when drawn in and blended again when drawn out? Or
perhaps not antialiased when when drawn out since composition mode is
then set to 'clear' which implies no blending, so no antialiasing? )

512:
Add markup legends to QEImage. Still need to add properties to name and
enable the legends. Currently always enabled with default names. There
is still a bug where draging markup items (and the legends) leaves an
artifact from the legend over the image.
