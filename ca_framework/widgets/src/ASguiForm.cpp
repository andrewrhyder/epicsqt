/*! This class is used as a container for QCa widgets.

    It adds any variable name macro substitutions to the current environment profile, creates a form widget and
    reads a UI file which can contain QCa widgets.

    As QCa widgets are created, they note the current environment profile, including variable name substitutions.
    QCa widgets also register themselves with this class so this class can activate them once they are fully created.
    QCa widgets can't activate themselves. The Qt form loader creates each widget and calls the appropriate property
    functions to set it up. The widget itself does not know what properties are going to be set and when they have
    all been set. For this reason the QCa widgets don't know when to request CA data. Both variable name properties
    and variable name substitution properties must be set up to request data and other properties may need to be set
    up before udates can be used.

    This class can be used directly (within a GUI application) as the top level form, or as a base class for
    the ASguiFormPlugin class. The ASguiFormPlugin plugin class is used to store a gui form in a UI file.
